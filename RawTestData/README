Position_vs_time.txt: These files contain the output displacement over time for the experimental prototype data

Test.xlxs: these files contain the Input displacement and Force at the input over time. 

Test.mp4: these are the videos used to get the corresponding output displacement data

REGARDING THE TESTS:

12_1, displacement from 0 to 3 to -3 to 0 mm. 
12_2, displacement from 0 to -3 to 3 to 0 mm. 
12_3, displacement from 3 to -3 to 3 mm. 
12_4, displacement from -3 to 3 to -3 mm. 

22_1, This is the test that was used for stress relaxation in supplementary material, displacement from 0 to 1 to 0 mm.
