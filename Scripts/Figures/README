Here the explanation of which script belongs to which figure will be given.

!!!!!Dont forget that for almost all these scripts the class system file (Data.m) and the dataset with simulations (DataSetf.mat) should be downloaded
as well and put in the same folder as the scripts.!!!!!

The scripts needed to get the result:

!!!!In the scripts itself is explained what else is needed to correctly execute them!!!!
